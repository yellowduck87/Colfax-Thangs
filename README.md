#About Colfax Thangs

Along the journey, the play realises that there is something amiss as they enter locations, collect items, and meet strange people. The user must find certain items and answer questions correctly to move on in the game. The goal is to collect all of the things and understand what lies beneath the bizarre occurrences that happen on Colfax.
The game ends in a boss battle where the user can use thier found items to help them defeat the boss.
